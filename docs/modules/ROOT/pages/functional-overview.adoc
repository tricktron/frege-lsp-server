= Functional Overview

The Frege Integrated Development IDE powers language features for the https://github.com/frege/frege[Frege programming language]. Language features help developers to write code more efficiently by providing language specific support during the development process. There are https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#languageFeatures[many different language features], such as showing compile warnings and errors, providing autocompletion suggestions and additional information while hovering over source code, etc. While the Frege IDE powers the language features with the help of the Frege compiler, the text editor visualises them to provide a fast feedback loop. See the xref:context.adoc[Context] page for an overview of all involved systems and users.
