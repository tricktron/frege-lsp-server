this Section, we want to examine how the functional core, outer shell design pattern was implemented for the hover feature with the following three steps: Impure Input Compile Frege source code, extract and save the compiler global. Pure Core Extract the hover information (type signature) from the extracted compiler global and transform it to the LSP hover type. Impure Output Send the hover lsp data type back to the text editor using the LSP4J library. The functional core, outer shell design pattern generalises well: The code for the impure input is already implemented while the code skeleton for the impure output is given by the LSP4J library. As a result, only the pure core part needs a lot of effort to implement for new language features. The compile component is responsible for creating an in-memory model of all available compiler information. It uses a Java uriGlobals HashMap data structure to keep track of all openend Frege files in the text editor and its compiler information. The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for each Frege file is defined by the language server protocol (LSP), while the Global data type is defined by the Frege compiler. It stores all compiler information for the associated Frege file URI and is documented here. Figure 1 shows the sequence diagram for the compile component. Figure 1. A code change in the text editor calls the LSP component, which delegates the call to the Compile component. The Compile component compiles the given Frege file URI with the initialised projectGlobal and saves all returned newGlobals in the uriGlobals hashmap. The Compile component is layered according to the Write Core Logic in Frege, Use Java for LSP principle and shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Compile layers: The CompileService.java class calls the CompileExecutorLSP.fr module, which calls the CompileMakeMode.fr module. The CompileMakeMode.fr is the core part, which calls the Frege compiler to compile the Frege file with the given project global. The returned list of globals is of type IO and thus impure. This IO [Global] list is then first converted by the CompileMakeMode.fr to IOMutalbe (ArrayList Global) and finally to the Java native type List As a final step the uriGlobals hashmap is upated with the new globals. The impure compileMake :: String → Global → IO [Global] is the core function. It uses a slight variation of the Frege compiler’s make mode, which automatically compiles all dependent modules first. It differs only in the return type by always returning a list of globals. For this to work, the Frege compiler needs to know the common Frege main source directory, which is configured through the project global and retrieved by the Project component. This builds the basis to make the Frege IDE workspace/project-aware and satisfy the usability quality attribute. The three Global monads in the Frege compiler Figure 3. The three Global monads in the Frege comiler. The StG is pure, while the StIO Global and IO Global are impure, beautifully showing the separation of concerns. We can switch from the StG to the StIO Global monad with the liftStG function and from StIO Global to IO Global with the evalStateT function. There also exist the two convenient get global state functions getST for StG and getSTT for StIO Global. Figure 4 shows the sequence diagram for the hover component. Figure 4. Hovering over an expression in the text editor calls the LSP component, which finds the global for the Frege file and delegates the call to the Hover component. The Hover component extracts the type signature from the global, transforms it to the LSP type Hover and returns it to the LSP, which forwards it back to the text editor. The Hover component is layered according to the Write Core Logic in Frege, Use Java for LSP principle and shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Hover layers: The HoverService.java class creates the Frege PositionLSP type and calls the HoverLSP.fr module. The HoverLSP.fr module converts the PositionLSP type to the core Position type to make the core logic data types independent of the LSP types. It then calls the Hover.fr module to compute the type signature, which is returned as Maybe Hover signaling that there may be no available type for the requested hover expression. As a final step the core data type Maybe Hover is transformed back to the Maybe HoverLSP type and returned to the HoverService.java class. The whole interaction is pure because there is no IO involved. The getTypeOnHover function is responsible for the main work and shown in Listing 1. Listing 1. The getTypeOnHover Function getTypeOnHover :: Position -> StateT Global Maybe Hover (1) getTypeOnHover pos = do global <- StateT.get token <- findToken pos (2) qname <- tokenToQName token (2) symbol <- findSymbol qname (2) symbolType <- getSymbolType symbol (2) pure $ Hover (3) { range = tokenToRange token, content = FregeCodeBlock symbolType } 1 The function uses the monad transformer concept to combine the State Global and the Maybe Hover monad. 2 The main logicWe find the needed type in the big Global record by moving from token → qualifiedName → symbol → symbolType. 3 As a last step, we transform the result to our core data type Hover. Since the core is pure and since we developed it with a Test-Driven Development approach it is testable as shown Listing 2. Listing 2. A Hover test case checking the type signature of a string constant shouldShowLocalVaridTypeSignature :: Property shouldShowLocalVaridTypeSignature = once $ morallyDubiousIOProperty do (1) fregeHoverCode = \"module HoverTest where\\n\\n\" ++ \"simplyString = \\\"Hello\\\"\" global <- standardCompileGlobal compiledGlobal <- compile fregeHoverCode global expected = Just Hover { range = Range { start = Position 3 1, end = Position 3 13 }, content = FregeCodeBlock \"simplyString :: String\" } actual = getTypeSignatureOnHover (Position 3 3) compiledGlobal pure $ expected == actual 1 The acute reader might notice the morallyDubiousIOProperty and think that the test is not pure. You are right: For the test setup we need to compile the code first, which is as illustrated the impure first step. Since a pure function cannot call an impure function in Frege, we need to execute the whole test in the impure IO context. The getTypeOnHover function, however, remains pure. This last step is delegated to the LSP4J library. As a result, we just follow the guidelines and implement the hover binding as shown in Constraints.","title":"Code","component":"frege-ide","version":"1.0","name":"code","url":"/frege-ide/1.0/code.html","titles":[{"text":"Impure Input","hash":"_impure_input","id":1},{"text":"Pure Hover Core","hash":"_pure_hover_core","id":2},{"text":"Impure Output","hash":"_impure_output","id":3}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"The following constraints are imposed upon the Frege IDE. Interoperability is the Frege IDE’s highest priority quality attribute and it can only be satisfied if the communication between the text editor and the Frege IDE is standardized. The LSP emerged as the communication standard. As a result, the Frege IDE must implement the LSP. The LSP uses a client-server model with a remote procedure call JSON (JSON-RPC) message format and supports standard input output, pipes and sockets as communication channels. The text editor takes the role of the client while the Frege IDE acts as the server. The protocol consists of a header and a content part and specifies three types of messsages: Notification which does not require a response. Request which requires a response. Response which matches a request. Hence, every supported interaction is either started by a notification or request message. Figure 1 shows the exchanged messages when the user opens a Frege file: Figure 1. The user opens a Frege file in the text editor which initialises the Frege IDE first. Since the initialize message is a request, it requires a response. Afterwards the didOpen notification is sent to the Frege IDE. Since it is a notification, it does not require a response. However, the Frege IDE uses this moment to compile the openend Frege file and reports back any warnings and errors as diagnostics to the text editor. Listing 1 shows the JSON-RPC message of the textDocument/publishDiagnostics notification from Figure 1. Listing 1. The JSON shows the JSON-RPC message of the textDocument/publishDiagnostics notification from Figure 1. Content-Length: ...\\r\\n \\r\\n { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 4, \"method\": \"textDocument/publishDiagnostics\", \"params\": { \"uri\": \"file:///Users/.../Hello.fr\", \"diagnostics\": [ { \"range\": { \"start\": { \"line\": 5, \"character\": 8 }, \"end\": { \"line\": 5, \"character\": 19 } }, \"severity\": 3, \"source\": \"frege compiler\", \"message\": \"value `result` is not used anywhere.\" }] } } The LSP specification divides the supported messages into the following groups which are summarized for brevity: Lifecycle Messages signal the start and exit of the client-server interaction. Examples are intialize and shutdown. Document Synchronization signals document specific messages such as didOpen, didChange and didSave. Documents with a corresponding URI are the basic units for files and folders. Language Features are language specific code smarts visualised by the text editor which help developers to write code faster. Examples are Goto Declaration, Hover and PublishDiagnostics. Workspace Features A workspace is an opened project in a text editor with one or more root folders. Example messages are didChangeWatchedFiles, workspaceSymbol and didChangeConfiguration. Window Features are messages related to the user interface such as ShowMessage and Create Work Done Progress. Document Ownership and its Single Source of Truth The didOpen notification transfers the ownership of the document to the text editor by loading it into a buffer. As a result, the document’s single source of truth lies now in the text editor’s buffer and not on the file system anymore. The didChange notification propagates changes on the buffer to the server. The single source of truth is only synced to the file system after the didSave notification. As a consequence, a server should not read the document from filesystem between the didOpen and didSave notification. If the server needs to read from the filesystem it should use the didChangeWatchedFiles instead of the didChange notification. There are existing software development kits (SDKs) which provide language bindings for the LSP types, the JSON-RPC format and its asychronous message exchange. Implementing the LSP in Frege was out of scope and therefore we use the LSP4J library for the Frege IDE. After setting up LSP4J, we only need to implement the org.eclipse.lsp4j.services.LanguageServer, org.eclipse.lsp4j.services.LanguageServer.TextDocumentService and org.eclipse.lsp4j.services.WorkspaceService interfaces. Listing 2 shows and explains how LSP4J works and helps with an example of the hover language feature. Listing 2. The Hover Feature with LSP4J class FregeTextDocumentService implements TextDocumentService { ... @Override public CompletableFuture hover(HoverParams params) (1) { return HoverService.hover(params); (2) } ... } 1 LSP4J provides the CompletableFuture type for the asynchronous message exchange and the HoverParams and Hover types which correspond to the LSP types of the hover specification. 2 The actual work is performed in the HoverService class. As a consequence, we do not need to worry about correctly creating a JSON-RPC message and the asynchronous complexity of the message exchange. Instead, we just use the types provided by LSP4J. Figure 2. The Frege Compiler first transpiles .fr files to .java files and then runs the java compiler to create .class files. The Frege compiler transpiles .fr files to .java files. By default, it then calls the Java compiler to compile the .java files to .class files. The Java compilation step can be turned off with the -j flag so that the Frege compiler only acts as a transpiler. The compiler manpage lists all supported flags and configurations for more information. The Frege compiler contains all possible information for the Frege language features. Extracting the needed language feature and transforming it to an language sever protocol type is the core task of the Frege IDE. Hence the integration boundary between the Frege IDE and the Frege compiler is the most crucial relationship. Since the Frege compiler is written in Frege, we want to write the Frege IDE’s core part in Frege as well to reduce the complexity of the Frege IDE - Frege compiler boundary. We use Java with the Language Server Protocol 4 Java (LSP4J) library only and Frege for everything else. See Principles for more information. Listing 3. A pure and and impure function. If a function is impure it is of type IO, otherwise it is pure. Therefore the function average is pure, while the main function is impure. module Compute where average :: Real a => [a] -> a average [] = error \"no average for empty lists\" average xs = sum xs / fromIntegral (length xs) main :: IO () main = do println $ average [1, 2, 3] -- prints 2.0 Frege is a purely functional language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The strong and static type system with global type inference combined with the purity characteristic lead to the following powerful guarantee: The type system not only distinguishes if an expression is pure or impure (causing a side-effect) at compile time, as shown in Listing 3, but it also enforces that a pure function cannot call an impure action. As a result, the Frege language has builtin support for the separation of concerns (SoC) design principle by separating pure code from side-effect causing actions. Pure code is desirable because it can be cached, tested and evaluated lazily, in advance or concurrently. Applying the SoC to a program thus benefits not only its modularity and testability but also allows the compiler to optimize the pure code part. The functional core, outer shell design pattern aims at exactly these quality attributes for its pure core. The abovementioned guarantee and its advantages do not uniquely apply to Frege but to other purely functional languages such as Haskell, Purescript and F# too. However, Frege is the only language that guarantees them for the JVM. Herein lies its main contribution: It allows developers to adopt the functional paradigm with its design patterns and benefits to build a functional architecture on the vast ecosystem of the JVM. Even more information on Frege can be found on its official Github repository. Language features can be divided into three levels, depending on their capabilities as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. The three levels of language features: Basic is the first level, single-file support the second and project/workspace aware the most advanced. Basic Provides syntax highlighting and language snippets. These features can be provided with a language extension only. Single-File Provides language features, such as completions, hovers, signature help and document symbols for a single-file only. These features are usually powered by a separete program, called the language server. Project/Workspace Aware Provides language features across files. This is especially important for programming languages since a project almost always consists of multiple dependent files. Capturing the project structure and its dependency model is usually delegated to a specialised build tool. The Frege IDE needs to be project/workspace aware to satisfy the Usability attribute. In order to achieve this, the Frege IDE adds Frege project support to a build tool and extracts project specific configuration from the build tool. See Context for the big picture and Software Architecture for more details.","title":"Constraints","component":"frege-ide","version":"1.0","name":"constraints","url":"/frege-ide/1.0/constraints.html","titles":[{"text":"Language Server Protocol (LSP)","hash":"_language_server_protocol_lsp","id":1},{"text":"Language Server Protocol 4 Java (LSP4J)","hash":"lsp4j","id":2},{"text":"Frege Compiler","hash":"_frege_compiler","id":3},{"text":"Frege and Java","hash":"_frege_and_java","id":4},{"text":"Why Frege?","hash":"_why_frege","id":5},{"text":"Build Tool","hash":"_build_tool","id":6}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"The Frege Integrated Development Environment (IDE) adds language features for the Frege programming language to a text editor.

Figure 1. The Functional core is surrounded by an imperative shell. We apply this for the following three steps: Impure Input Parse and compile the Frege source code. Pure Core Extract the requested language feature. Impure Output Transform and send the requested language feature back to the text editor. Keeping the middle step pure provides us with the inherited benefits of pure code, the most important one being great testability. A language feature is divided into three layers. As an example, we have a closer look at the hover feature: Hover.fr The core logic which extracts the hover information from the compiler global. Must be testable in isolation. Written in Frege. HoverLSP.fr Transforms the extracted hover information to the language server protocol (LSP) data types. Written in Frege. HoverService.java Sends the result to the text editor using LSP4J. This class is not allowed to call the Hover class directly (e.g. imports of the Hover class are forbidden). Instead it must go through the HoverLSP class. Written in Java. The hover feature is usually built bottom up starting with a Frege test in the core logic layer. The core Frege logic should be built using test-driven development. While Frege has builtin support for property-based testing, it lacks a traditional unit test framework. As a workaround, we use the once function to mimick a unit test as can be seen in Listing 1. The tests are written in the same Frege file as the code. Listing 1. Mimicking a Unit Test with a Property fregeLSPServerShouldMapNoCompilerMessagesToEmptyArray :: Property fregeLSPServerShouldMapNoCompilerMessagesToEmptyArray = once $ morallyDubiousIOProperty do fregeCodeWithoutError = \"module CorrectFregeTest where\\n\\n\" ++ \"ok = 42 + 42\" global <- standardCompileGlobal compiledGlobal <- compile fregeCodeWithoutError global expected = [] actual = getDiagnostics compiledGlobal pure $ expected == actual This follows naturally from the Functional Core, Imperative Shell design principle. We only test the core logic we build. We neither test the LSP nor the correct compilation functionality because the first is the responsibility of the LSP4J library and the latter is the responsibility of the Frege compiler. A feature should be testable in isolation. Hence, we group the different classes by feature and put them into a common module/package. E.g. the hover package contains the Hover.fr HoverLSP.fr and HoverService.java classes.","title":"Principles","component":"frege-ide","version":"1.0","name":"principles","url":"/frege-ide/1.0/principles.html","titles":[{"text":"Functional Core, Imperative Shell","hash":"funCore","id":1},{"text":"Write Core Logic in Frege, Use Java for LSP","hash":"fregeCore","id":2},{"text":"Test-Driven Development","hash":"_test_driven_development","id":3},{"text":"Do Not Test the LSP, do not Test the Frege Compiler","hash":"_do_not_test_the_lsp_do_not_test_the_frege_compiler","id":4},{"text":"Frege Modules & Java Packages are Feature Driven","hash":"_frege_modules_java_packages_are_feature_driven","id":5}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"The Frege IDE’s architecture should satisfy the following quality attributes, also known as non-functional requirements, listed from highest to lowest priority.

It is written in Java. Frege Language Extension Currently, there only exists the Visual Studio Code Extension, which adds Frege language support to the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) text editor. It follows the official VS Code language server extension guidelines and is written in Typescript. The Frege language server is the core container of the Frege IDE. Figure 3.

If the developer has setup his Frege project without any build tool, sane defaults are provided. The configuration is forwarded as compiler options to the compile component. Written in Java. Compile Runs the Frege compiler, extracts all available compiler information called global and saves them in memory. Impure Frege Module. Diagnostics Responsible for the diagnostics language feature. Extracts all available errors and warnings from the compiler global and transforms them to the LSP diagnostics type. Pure Frege module. Hover Responsible for the hover language feature. Extracts all available type signatures of functions and variables from the compiler global and transforms them to LSP hover type. Pure Frege module.

Alternatively, you can specify the location on the command line with --mainModule=my.mod.HelloFrege. compileFrege Compiles all your *.fr files in mainSourceDir to outputDir. Alternatively, you can also specify the compile items by with the compileItems property. Then only the specified compile items and its dependencies get compiled. E.g.: compileItems = [ 'my.mod.Mod1', my.mod.Mod2' ]. compileTestFrege Same as compileFrege but compiles all your *.fr files in mainSourceDir to testOutputDir. Used by the testFrege task. runFrege Runs the Frege module specified by mainModule. Alternatively you can also pass the main module by command line, e.g: gradle runFrege --mainModule=my.mod.Name. testFrege Tests all QuickCheck properties defined in the specified testModules. You can pass test args on the command line, e.g: gradle testFrege --args=\"-v -n 1000 -p pred1. Run gradle testFrege --args=-h to see all options. replFrege Takes care of all project dependencies of the specified replModule and prints the command to start the Frege REPL and load the replModule. E.g.: (echo :l && cat) | java -cp frege.repl.FregeRepl. On Unix you can even further automate starting the repl and loading the module with the following one-liner: eval $(./gradlew -q replFrege). The tooling component exposes configuration relevant for the Frege compiler through the Gradle Tooling API. The exposed configuration parameters are declared in the FregeProjectInfo class. See the Github repository for how to install, use it and more details. The VS Code Frege language extension adds Frege support to the Visual Studio Code editor.
